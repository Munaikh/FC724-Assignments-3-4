### Summary :
Version control has been immensely helpful in managing this project. It has allowed me to work on the project simultaneously without fearing losing any progress. Additionally, it has enabled me to keep track of all the changes I've made to the project and revert to previous versions if necessary. This has been particularly useful when I've made mistakes and needed to return to an earlier version. The version control has also helped me track when and where I made changes. Overall, version control has made managing this project much easier and more efficient.

### Working with others:
When collaborating with others on a project, I will create separate branches for each new feature we plan to add. For example, I will make a branch for feature X and another for feature Y. This ensures I can work on the project without affecting the main branch. Once I finish my work, I will merge my branch and the others with the main branch. This allows us to work together without risking losing the project or affecting the main branch. Moreover, it helps us keep track of the changes made by each person and revert to previous versions if required.
